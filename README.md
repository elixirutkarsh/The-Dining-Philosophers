# The-Dining-Philosophers
There are five philosophers sitting at a table, each with a bowl of soup in front of them. There are five forks on the table, one for each philosopher. The philosophers can only eat their soup if they have both a fork in their left hand and a fork in their right hand. However, there is only one fork between each philosopher. How can the philosophers eat their soup?

Solution:

The philosophers can eat their soup if they coordinate their actions. For example, the first philosopher can pick up the fork to their left and the philosopher to their right can pick up the fork to their left. Then, the first philosopher can eat their soup, and the philosopher to their right can pick up the fork to their right. This process can then be repeated for the remaining philosophers.
